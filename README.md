# Prediction of Default Payments of Credit Card Clients

In this report is presented some details of data exploration, and the prediction of defaulting person with machine learning programs in the classification problem.

## Introduction

The dataset used in this report consist in an open database with default payments of clients in Taiwan. This dataset is available for download in 
<a href=“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients“> UCI – Machine Learning Repository</a>.  The dataset can be used for a binary classification in order to predict whether the client will pay the bill amount or to estimate the real probability of default payment. 
This report shares some details of data exploration and machine learning models training for a binary classification. After getting the scores of recall and accuracy for every model which was trained in Python language, I decided to make the analysis statistic of results in R language. For each model trained with Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNeighbors algorithms were made ten versions summarising thirty models.   
Finally, I apply the model in real financial problem for the two best models trained and I show how much money can be saved.
